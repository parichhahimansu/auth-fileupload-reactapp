Download Both auth-fileupload-reactapp and Download Both auth-fileupload-nodeapp

Start Node app as - npm run serve => will run at http://localhost:4000/

Start React app as - npm start => will run at http://localhost:3000/

Now Sign in as 

username => admin
password => 123

File will be uploaded to imgBB api. As of now there is no feature to list images from imgBB.

Alternate to imgBB like imgUR can be used to serve the purpose with proper AUTH.

Thanks
